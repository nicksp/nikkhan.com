Just in case it might useful for anyone else. Free up space on your hard drive by recursively deleting all `/node_modules/` within a given directory. The commands are Mac/Linux compatible.

```bash
# Get a total size of 'node_modules' folders
find . -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -print | xargs du -chs

# This will REMOVE ALL found 'node_modules' folders
find . -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -print -exec rm -rf '{}' +
```

**Warning:** Use the commands above at your own risk ðŸ˜›
